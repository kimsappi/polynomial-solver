# About
Hive project "Computor v1": polynomial equation solver (constant, linear, quadratic). First attempt at Java. Very much WIP.

# Goal
To be able to solve constant, linear and quadratic equations given as a parameter string.

# Instructions
```shell
cd src
make
java com.computor.Main "insert valid equation"
```

# Possible improvements
* Third degree equation support
* Division support for terms
* Parenthesis support
* A more robust `sqrt()`
* Multivariate support (e.g. "x + y = y")
